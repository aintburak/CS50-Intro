# CS50 Week 4: Memory

## Overview
Week 4 of CS50 delves into the concepts of memory management, pointers, and data structures. This week's content is fundamental for understanding how software interacts with hardware to manage data efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how memory is allocated and managed in C.
- Learn to use pointers for more complex data manipulation.
- Explore data structures like arrays, linked lists, and more.
- Introduce memory allocation, memory leaks, and debugging tools.

## Lecture
Key topics covered in this week's lecture include:
- **Memory Basics**: Understanding bytes, memory addresses.
- **Pointers**: Concept, usage, and common pitfalls.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: `malloc`, `free`, and memory management.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and usage of arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables.
- **Debugging**: Tools like `valgrind` to detect memory leaks and errors.

## Shorts
Supplementary short videos provide detailed explanations on specific concepts like pointers, memory allocation, and data structures.

## Problem Set
Problem Set 4 often challenges students to:
1. **Implement dynamic data structures**: Such as linked lists or trees.
2. **Manage memory**: Correctly allocate and free memory.
3. **Utilize pointers**: Efficiently use pointers to manipulate data.

### Problem Set Tasks:
- **Memory Lab**: Practical exercises involving memory allocation and usage.
- **Data Structure Implementation**: Implement and manipulate one or more data structures.

## Tips for Success
- Practice pointer arithmetic and manipulation in small, simple programs before applying them in larger tasks.
- Regularly run `valgrind` or similar tools to check your code for memory leaks.
- Use debugger frequently to understand how your programs handle memory in real-time.


Understanding memory is another important topic for logical thinking, impacting both the efficiency and correctness of software. The skills learned this week are foundational for all future programming and software development tasks.
