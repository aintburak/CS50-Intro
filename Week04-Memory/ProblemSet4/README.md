# CS50 Problem Set 4: Memory

## Overview
In Problem Set 4, you'll dive deep into the workings of computer memory, learning how to manipulate pointers, dynamically allocate memory, and understand the lifecycle of memory allocation in C. This problem set is designed to give you hands-on experience with critical concepts that are foundational for any system-level programming.

## Learning Objectives
- Master the use of pointers for advanced data manipulation.
- Understand and implement dynamic memory allocation.
- Create and manipulate data structures like linked lists.
- Identify and fix common memory-related errors such as memory leaks.

## Tasks
This problem set may involve several tasks such as:

### 1. **Memory Lab**
- Implement functions to manipulate blocks of memory, mimicking the functionality of standard library functions.

### 2. **Linked List**
- Create a linked list structure and write functions for inserting, deleting, and searching elements within the list.

### 3. **Recover**
- Implement a program that recovers deleted JPEGs from a forensic image, demonstrating your understanding of file I/O and memory management.

## Instructions

### Setup
- Download the distribution code from [CS50's resource page](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/).
- Set up your development environment with the necessary tools and libraries.

### Development
- Follow the specifications provided in the problem set instructions carefully.
- Use tools like `valgrind` to check for memory leaks and other memory-related issues.

### Testing
- Test each part of your code individually before integrating.
- Use CS50's `check50` to automate testing and ensure your solutions meet the specifications.

## Submission
- Submit your problem set via CS50's submission tool as detailed in the course's instructions.
- Ensure that all parts of the problem set are completed and thoroughly tested before submission.
