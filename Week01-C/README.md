# Lecture 1 - CS50x 2024

## Overview
Week 1 of CS50 introduces the basics of computer science and programming, with a focus on the C programming language. The week covers foundational concepts in computer science, programming syntax in C, and practical problem-solving techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Computational Thinking**: Introduction to the concepts of abstraction, algorithms, and data structures.
- **C Programming Basics**:
  - Syntax and semantics of C.
  - Data types and operators.
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
  - Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
  - Functions, libraries, and header files.
  - Compilation process and debugging techniques.
- **Memory**:
  - Understanding stack vs. heap.
  - Introduction to pointers and memory allocation.

## Lecture Highlights
- **Hello, World**: Students write their first C program, a simple print statement that outputs "Hello, World".
- **Mario More and Less**: Building a program that prints out a pyramid using hashes (`#`) as blocks, simulating the pyramids from the Mario video game.
- **Cash or Credit**: Introduction to more complex problem-solving where students develop applications to calculate minimum coins required for change (Cash) or validate credit card numbers using Luhn’s Algorithm (Credit).

## Assignments
- **Problem Set 1**: Includes writing simple programs in C that reinforce the concepts taught during the lecture, such as input/output, using libraries, and implementing algorithms.

## Tools and Resources
- **CS50 IDE**: An introduction to using CS50's Integrated Development Environment for coding, testing, and submitting assignments.
- **Style Guide**: Emphasis on writing clean, readable, and well-documented code as per CS50’s style guidelines.

## Advice for Students
- Start the problem sets early to manage time effectively.
- Utilize `help50`, `check50`, and `style50` tools provided by CS50 to get feedback on your code.
