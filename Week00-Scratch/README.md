# CS50 Week 0 - Scratch

## Introduction

Welcome to Week 0 of Harvard's CS50! This week, we dive into the basics of programming with an introduction to Scratch, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Scratch allows users to create programs using a simple, graphical interface that teaches the fundamentals of programming flow without typing out code.

## Overview

- **Lecture**: Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.
- **Problem Set**: Create a project in Scratch.

## Lecture

David J. Malan introduces the basics of computer science and programming using Scratch, explaining concepts such as variables, loops, conditions, and more. The lecture is interactive, with live examples illustrating how to begin programming in Scratch.

## Problem Set 0

**Objective:** Create anything of interest in Scratch, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:
- Must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Must use at least one sound.

**Guidelines:**
- Your project should strive to be as creative as possible. It should be clear that time and effort were put into the design and implementation of your project.
- Feel free to explore the Scratch's tutorials and resources for inspiration and guidance.

## How to Submit

1. Complete your Scratch project and save it on the Scratch website.
2. Submit the URL of your project in your CS50 coursework submission.
