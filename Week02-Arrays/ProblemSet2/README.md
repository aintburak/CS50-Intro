# Problem Set 2

Collaboration on problem sets is restricted, except for seeking assistance from classmates and others as long as it does not involve having someone else complete the work for you, in accordance with the course's academic honesty policy.

The course staff conducts random audits of CS50x submissions. Students found violating this policy will be expelled from the course. Those who have already completed CS50x, if found violating, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.

## What to Do

1. Log in to cs50.dev using your GitHub account with Chrome, Edge, or Safari (not Firefox).
2. Run `update50` in your codespace's terminal window to ensure it is up-to-date, and when prompted, click "Rebuild now."
3. Submit Scrabble.
4. Submit Readability.
5. Choose one:
   - Submit Caesar if you feel less confident.
   - Submit Substitution if you feel more confident.
   If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, we'll consider the higher of your two scores..

## Advice

- Experiment with any of David's programs from class through Week 2's examples.
- Visit [manual.cs50.io](manual.cs50.io) to view the manual pages for C functions.
- If you encounter errors while compiling your code with `make`, focus on fixing the initial error you encounter, scrolling up as necessary. If unsure of its meaning, try asking `help50` for assistance. For example, if compiling readability with `make readability` yields errors, try running `help50 make readability` instead.
