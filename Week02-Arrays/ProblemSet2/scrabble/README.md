## Description
This program is part of the CS50 course's Week 2 assignment. It's designed to calculate the Scrabble score of words provided by the user. Each letter has a specific point value, and the program will sum these values to get the total score for each word entered.

## Features
- **Calculate Scores:** Input a word and receive the Scrabble score based on standard English Scrabble letter values.
- **Replayability:** Continue entering words until you choose to exit the program.
- **Case Insensitivity:** The program treats uppercase and lowercase letters equally.
