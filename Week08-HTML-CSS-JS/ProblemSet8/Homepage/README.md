# CS50 Homepage Exercise

## Overview

This Homepage Exercise is part of Problem Set 8 in CS50. It requires students to build a personal homepage using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. This page should introduce the user, provide links to social media, showcase projects, and offer a downloadable resume.

- **Social Media Links**: Direct links to the user's professional and social networking profiles such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and Twitter.
- **Project Portfolio**: An overview of the user's key projects or contributions, each linked to further details or live project sites.
- **Resume**: A downloadable link to the user's current resume in PDF format.
