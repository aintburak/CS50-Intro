# CS50 Capstone Project - Federated Learning

## Overview

This README focuses on the federated learning component of the Capstone Project, an innovative chat application that enhances user privacy and model accuracy through decentralized machine learning. The application is built using React, Flask, and the federated learning framework to enable a privacy-preserving machine learning environment.

## Federated Learning in the Capstone Project CS50x

The Capstone Project implements federated learning to improve its image classification features while maintaining user privacy. This approach allows the application to learn from decentralized data sources without the need to store personal data centrally.

### How It Works

- **Data Localization**: Users' data remains on their devices, preventing privacy breaches.
- **Model Training**: The application trains local models on users' devices using their data.
- **Model Aggregation**: Periodically, the server aggregates these models to improve the overall model without ever accessing the raw data.

### Benefits

- **Privacy Preservation**: By design, federated learning ensures that all training data remains on the user's device, enhancing data security.
- **Model Robustness**: Aggregating diverse local models improves the overall model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to scale effortlessly as more users participate in the federated learning process.

## Installation and Setup

To participate in the federated learning process, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Capstone Project
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

## Running the Federated Server

To start the federated learning server:

```bash
python server.py
```

This server will coordinate the model training across multiple devices and handle the aggregation of the models.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Security Protocols**: Implementing cutting-edge security measures to protect the federated learning process.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Optimizing the model aggregation process to handle thousands of clients simultaneously.
- **Broader Model Applications**: Expanding the model's capabilities to include more complex image and text analysis tasks.
