# CS50 Problem Set 3: Algorithms

## Introduction
This problem set focuses on implementing efficient algorithms. You'll be challenged to understand, use, and improve algorithms to solve problems more effectively.

## Overview of Tasks
Problem Set 3 typically includes several problems that test your understanding of algorithmic concepts such as sorting, searching, and time complexity.

### 1. Searching
Implement a program that uses a searching algorithm to find a number in a list of numbers.

#### Requirements:
- Implement a search algorithm.
- Test the algorithm with multiple datasets.

### 2. Sorting
Implement a program that sorts a list of numbers using a sorting algorithm.

#### Requirements:
- Choose a sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, etc.).
- Implement the sorting algorithm.
- Ensure your algorithm sorts an array of integers correctly.

### 3. Time Complexity
Analyze the time complexity of different algorithms.

#### Requirements:
- Explain the time complexity of your implemented algorithms.
- Compare the time complexity with other sorting or searching algorithms.
