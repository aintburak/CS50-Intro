# QuickSort Algorithm

## Overview
QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

QuickSort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets and is a common choice in the domain of computer science.

## How QuickSort Works
1. **Pivot Selection**: First, a 'pivot' element is chosen from the array. The role of the pivot is key, as it will help in partitioning the array. The pivot can be the first element, the last element, the middle element, or even a random element of the array.
2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before it and all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it. After this step, the pivot is in its final position.
3. **Recursively Apply**: Apply steps 1 and 2 recursively to the sub-array of elements with smaller values and the sub-array of elements with greater values.

## Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)

The worst case occurs when the partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot.

## Space Complexity
- O(log n)

This space complexity accounts for the stack space used by the recursive calls.

## Usage
QuickSort is used when:
- The average expected time complexity of O(n log n) is desirable.
- Space efficiency is a concern (in-place sorting).

It's less optimal when:
- Predictable performance is needed (as the worst-case scenario is significantly slower).

## Conclusion
QuickSort is a powerful algorithm that performs well in most scenarios but can run into performance issues in certain edge cases due to its pivot selection and partitioning mechanism.
